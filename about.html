		<h3>Intro to Database Systems</h3>
			<hr class="hr2" />
			
		<p>This course focuses on the fundamentals of database systems. Students will go over database
		vs. file management systems; functions, components, and peronnel used in a database; client-server,
		database, and transaction processing architectures; and relational data models and operations. Students
		will also go over business requirement analysis, perform data definition, manipulation, and queries with 
		basic SQL. Concepts of database design, planning, and administration fundamentals, data, warehouring, and data mining
		will be studied.</p>
		<p>Assignments for students were introductory coding assignments regarding SQL and basic
		situations. As a final project, students have the option of partnering up to create a database
		of their choice. Personally, my partner and I created a database for cat adoptions in a cat cafe.</p>
						
			<hr class="hr4" />
					
		<h3>Networking Concepts</h3>
			<hr class="hr2" />
			
		<p>In this course, students dive into the components of networks and network designs.
		This includes the interrelationship of clients and servers within WANs and LANs, network architectures,
		protocols & access methods used within intranets, and the internet will be explained in detail.
		Functions of network operating systems (OS), such as Linux and Windows Server, will be inspected. 
		Environments, their services and their program-to-program communication protocols will be introduced. 
		System component protection and data security will be studied as well.</p>
		<p>Within this course there was a total of four projects to complete, each being a slideshow
		consisting of information introduced in the material.</p>
						
			<hr class="hr4" />
						
		<h3>Principles of Software Engineering</h3>
			<hr class="hr2" />
			
		<p>The primary focus of this course is on formal methods and approaches used in the design,
		developement, testing, and maintnence of computer software. Each individual stage of the software developement
		life cycle (SDLC) will be studied greatly. Subjects such as low-level design, high-level design,
		modeling with UML (Unified Modeling Language), iterative developement models, rapid application developement
		(RAD), formal testing methods, incremental deployment, formal metrics, as well as appropriate use of 
		associated tools will be covered with practical applications.</p>
		<p>Students are given creative freedom with the semester-long project that is an optional group project. 
		Groups of up to four students are tasked with creating software, whether it may be a game or some type
		of application, and present the final product to the instructor and participating students.</p>
						
			<hr class="hr4" />
				
		<h3>Object-Oriented Program (C++)</h3>
			<hr class="hr2" />
			
		<p>In this course, students will be taught in the syntax and semantics of the ANSI C++ language.
		Topics covered in class include control structures, arrays, pointers, strings, dynamic memory 
		management, class definition and object-based developement, file I?O, overloading, exception
		handling, and template libraries.</p>
		<p>Students are tasked with scenarios to fill in and create code in order to complete the assignments.</p>
						
			<hr class="hr4" />
					
		<h3>Mobile Application Developement (Android)</h3>
			<hr class="hr2" />
			
		<p>This class focuses on the design and implementation of wireless handheld application software
		the Android platform for personal and business use. Students will use the Android Studio integrated 
		developement environment (IDE) to create and test application software. Developement techniques will 
		focus on operational aspects of mobile devices that differentiate then from computers and general
		computing platforms.</p>
		<p>Android Studio is utilized to create applications for user interface, starting with a dice roll application,
		following with a calculator application, then progressing to a weather application, and finishing with
		an application of your choice. I had personally created an application that the user could make
		vetinarian appointments from a preset link in a drop-down menu, with the ability to set appointments
		in a calender within the application.</p>
